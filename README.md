### 💼 About Me

I’m a full-stack software developer with over 2 years of experience building secure, scalable web applications. I specialize in .NET Core and Vue.js development, with strong expertise in REST API integration, role-based access control (RBAC), CI/CD pipelines, and IIS-based deployments.
